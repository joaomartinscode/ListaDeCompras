# ListaDeCompras

**ListaDeCompras** is a C-based program designed for managing shopping lists as part of a university project on **Algorithms and Data Structures**. The program implements the concept of Abstract Data Types (ADT) to manage a collection of products and shopping lists. The user can perform operations like adding, removing, updating products, and managing shopping lists, including marking products as purchased.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Add, remove, and update products with attributes like name, type, price, and store.

- **Shopping List Management**: Create, delete, and rename shopping lists. Associate products with quantities and purchase status.
- **Product Operations**: Insert, remove, and update product information, including marking as purchased with price and store details.
- **Dynamic Array Management**: Uses dynamically allocated arrays for managing data.
